## Notes

- I made the assumption that the data for the search was stored in memory, rather than in an external system. Thus, I did not impliment entity framework or build a query on an instance of IQueryable<T>.
- When buliding the service library, I used a [hexagonal archetucture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)).
